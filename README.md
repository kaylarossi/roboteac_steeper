# The Roboteac Steeper 
This project has only one main code that runs the overall system. The main code "main.py"
starts the embedded system. It provides prompts on the RPi interface touchscreen which is 
then read back into the code and the appropriate action is next taken based on the code 
logic. There are numerous combinations of tea types and tea strengths to choice from in 
the prompts. Once choosen, the system will dispense the appropriate tea selected, the tea
diffuser will close through the system and be deposited into the mug where it will then 
steep. The steep time is determined based on tea type selected as well as strength. Once
steeping has commensed, the diffuser will be removed from the mug, the code finishes, and
the tea is brewed.

This project was a final project that was created by Kayla Rossi while enrolled
in the Embedded operating systems (ECE 5725) course at Cornell University in
completing her M.Eng degree in 2022.
